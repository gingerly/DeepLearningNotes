*Sort of continuous rather than discrete math.

*Tensors are like multi-dimensional arrays.

*If both x and y are solutions then x = ax + (1-a)y is also a solution for any real a.

*Image columns of A as different directions we can travel from the origin(vector of all zeros) and determine how many ways there are to reach the b.
Furthermore, x specifies how far we need to travel.
