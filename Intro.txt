Linear Models:
Learn the weights (w): f(x,w) = sum(x_i, w_i)

Stochastic Gradient used the weights of ADALINE:(Adaptive Linear Element).

Linear Models cannot learn XOR.

*Neuroscience inspired Deep Learning.

*one should not view deep learning as an attempt to simulate the brain but instead use linear algebra, probability, information theory, and numerical optimization.

*Connectionism:
Many intelligent units work together.
Distributed representation: Many Features, each of different inputs. Eg: Red Card, Red Bird, Green Car, Green Bird. We need two neurons.

*Backpropogation of errors.

*Long short-term memory or LSTM network.

*Deep belief network: Currently considered to be the best.

*Reason why machine learning is popular now instead of then: Today we can provide the algorithms the data they need. Everything is being recorded. Big Data has made it easier for machine learning algorithms to survive.
